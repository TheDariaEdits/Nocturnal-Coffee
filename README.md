# My Awesome Project
This is a website for a cafe that includes a menu, about us, and contact form.

**Link to project:** https://oasis-cafe.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma

This website used a considerable amount of JavaScript to create an array of pictures for the design. CSS was used for design instead of JS when possible to abide by progressive enhancement concerns.

## Optimizations

I would like to use SASS for style sheets moving forward. 

## Lessons Learned:

Responsiveness. Learning from my previous projects, I started with a mobile-first design and built media inquiries to build up the design. This made development significantly less complicated.

## Examples:
Take a look at these examples that I have in my portfolio:
